Under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9, credit losses ought to be recognised timeously and accurately. This requirement belies a certain degree of dynamicity when estimating the constituent parts of a credit loss event, most notably the probability of default (PD). It is notoriously difficult to produce such PD-estimates at every point of loan life that are adequately dynamic and accurate, especially when considering the ever-changing macroeconomic background. In rendering these lifetime PD-estimates, the choice of modelling technique plays an important role, which is why we first review a few classes of techniques, including the merits and limitations of each. Our main contribution however is the development of an in-depth and data-driven tutorial using a particular class of techniques called discrete-time survival analysis. This tutorial is accompanied by a diverse set of reusable diagnostic measures for evaluating various aspects of a survival model and the underlying data. A comprehensive R-based codebase is further contributed. We believe that our work can help cultivate common modelling practices under IFRS 9, and should be valuable to practitioners, model validators, and regulators alike.


## Structure
This R-codebase can be run sequentially using the file numbering itself as a structure. **Delinquency measures** are algorithmically defined in **DelinqM.R** as data-driven functions, which may be valuable to the practitioner outside of the study's current scope. These delinquency measures were formulated and empirically tested in [Botha2022](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358329458_The_loss_optimization_of_loan_recovery_decision_times_using_forecast_cashflows), as part of a loss optimisation exercise of recovery decision times, as implemented in the corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/The-loss-optimisation-of-loan-recovery-decision-times-using-forecast-cash-flows). A simulation study from [Botha2021](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350169758_Simulation-based_optimisation_of_the_timing_of_loan_recovery_across_different_portfolios) also demonstrated these delinquency measures at length, with its corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/Simulation-based-optimisation-of-the-timing-of-loan-recovery-across-different-portfolios). Similarly, the **TruEnd-procedure** from [Botha2025](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380214432_The_TruEnd-procedure_Treating_trailing_zero-valued_balances_in_credit_data) and its corresponding [R-codebase](https://github.com/arnobotha/TruEnd-Procedure)  is implemented in the **TruEnd.R** script, which includes a small variety of functions related to running the TruEnd-procedure practically.

## Data
This R-codebase assumes that monthly loan performance data is available. Naturally, the data itself can't be made publically available given its sensitive nature, as well as various data privacy laws, particularly the _Protection of Personal Information (POPI)_ Act of 2013 in South Africa. However, the structure and type of data that is required for reproducing this study, is sufficiently described in the commentary within the scripts. This should enable the practitioner to extract and prepare data accordingly. Moreover, this codebase assumes South African macroeconomic data is available, as sourced and collated by internal staff of the bank in question.
